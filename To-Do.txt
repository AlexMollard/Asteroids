Need To-Do:
- Get turret direction to bullet object
- Make bullets position move
- If bullet is off screen set _Alive to false
- *Draw Bullets*


Optional:
- Make GetBullet take longest alive bullet and kill it
  This could be done by making a array that could store 
  the bullet objects in order by what was fired first and
  then killing them if they are at the start of the array.
	- This Could cause a problem as it wouldn't be able to
	  delete elements once they are dead.
